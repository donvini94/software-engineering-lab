# Integration of Performability Analyses into CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This lab report details the design and implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for automated performability analysis, combining performance and reliability measurements of systems. The project integrates PMX (Performance Model eXtractor) from the University of WÃ¼rzburg and the Palladio Simulator from KIT into an automated workflow.

## Key Contributions
- Developed a complete CI/CD pipeline for performability analysis automation
- Successfully replicated the FZI infrastructure environment using NixOS
- Implemented Docker containerization for analysis tools:
  - PMX container for model extraction
  - Palladio container for simulation
  - Gnuplot container for results visualization

## Technical Implementation
- **Infrastructure Setup**
  - NixOS-based server configuration
  - GitLab instance with custom Docker registry
  - Multi-stage CI/CD pipeline architecture
  
- **Pipeline Design**
  - Extract stage: PMX analysis and data extraction 
  - Simulate stage: Palladio-based simulation
  - Plot stage: Results visualization using Gnuplot

- **Containerization**
  - Custom Dockerfiles for each component
  - Integration with private Docker registry
  - Automated artifact handling between stages

## Results & Achievements
- Fully automated performability analysis workflow
- Modular and maintainable pipeline architecture
- Visual representation of simulation results
- Successful reproduction of FZI environment

## Future Improvements
- Branch-specific simulation configurations
- Automated trace collection integration
- Enhanced pipeline flexibility
- Expanded simulation capabilities

This project was conducted at the Institute of Information Security and Dependability (KASTEL) at KIT under the supervision of M.Sc. Sebastian Weber.
