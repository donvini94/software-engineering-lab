# Lab Report for the lab "engineering driven software development" at KIT

As part of this lab, I set up a CI/CD-pipeline using Docker on a NixOS system. I set up a server, hosting a Docker Registry and Gitlab (Runner) instance, configuring everything with NixOS. The goal of this project was to develop a CI/CD-pipeline for continious performability analysis using the Performance Model eXtractor of the University of WÃ¼rzburg and Palladio Simulator from KIT for Performance predcition.
